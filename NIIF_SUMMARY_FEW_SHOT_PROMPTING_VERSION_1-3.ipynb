    "                    ## Structure Requirements:\n",
    "                    Create 7 distinct sections in this order:\n",

    "                    ### Content Approach:\n",
    "                    - Lead each section with a contextual overview sentence\n",
    "                    - Pack each paragraph with specific metrics, percentages, and data points\n",
    "                    - Use parentheses for precise figures: (9.5%), (USD 21.9 bn), (INR 2 trillion)\n",
    "                    - Blend multiple related data points in single sentences\n",
    "                    - Contrast positive and negative indicators within the same section\n",
    "\n",
    "                    ### Tone and Language:\n",
    "                    - Professional, analytical tone\n",
    "                    - Use measured language: \"navigates,\" \"measured moderation,\" \"mixed signals emerge\"\n",
    "                    - Include forward-looking elements and policy implications\n",
    "                    - Reference both domestic and global factors\n",
    "\n",
    "                    ### Data Presentation:\n",

    "\n",
    "                    ### Formatting:\n",
    "                    - Each section should be 2-4 sentences\n",
    "                    - Use hyphens to separate section headers from content\n",
    "                    - No bullet points - write in flowing paragraph form\n",
    "                    - Maintain consistent capitalization for abbreviations (USD, INR, GDP, etc.)\n",

    "                    ### Bullet Point Format:\n",
    "                    - Use bullet points (•) for each main section\n",
    "                    - Each bullet should be 1-2 comprehensive sentences\n",
    "                    - Pack multiple related data points into single sentences using contrasts\n",
    "                    - Separate contrasting indicators with \"while,\" \"led by,\" \"on,\" or \"remains\"\n",
    "\n",
    "                    ### Data Presentation:\n",
    "                    - Always include specific figures in parentheses: (INR 58.3 billion), (4.4%), (14.4 million), (0.2%)\n",
    "                    - Use abbreviated units consistently: INR, USD, FASTag, K tonnes, MW, GW, kg, troy oz\n",
    "                    - Include timeframes: Monthly periods, quarterly data, April, May, June\n",
    "                    - Present both absolute values and growth rates where relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "                    ### Language Patterns:\n",
    "                    - Start with record/headline infrastructure metrics, then add supporting data\n",
    "                    - Use infrastructure-specific language: \"hit,\" \"moderates,\" \"maintains momentum,\" \"drives,\" \"swing volatile\"\n",
    "                    - Employ contrast words: \"while,\" \"led by,\" \"remains,\" \"on,\" \"vs\"\n",
    "                    - Include operational and capacity utilization elements\n",

    "\n",
    "                    ## Key Formatting Rules:\n",
    "                    - Use parentheses for all numerical data: (INR 58.3 billion), (404 million), (USD 4 per kg)\n",
    "                    - Maintain consistent abbreviation style: FASTag, K tonnes, MW, GW, troy oz\n",
    "                    - No sub-bullets or nested points\n",
    "                    - Each bullet covers multiple but related infrastructure themes\n",
    "                    - Include both operational metrics and growth indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "                    ## Quality Indicators:\n",
    "                    - [ ] Each bullet contains 4-6 specific data points with appropriate units\n",
    "                    - [ ] Uses contrasting language to show mixed infrastructure performance\n",
    "                    - [ ] Balances current operations with capacity and growth metrics\n",
    "                    - [ ] Maintains consistent formatting and abbreviation standards\n",
    "                    - [ ] Flows logically from road → transport → aviation → power\n",
    "                    - [ ] Each bullet is substantive (35-55 words) but dense with operational data\n",
